Abstract
We present the Aladin Equation, a novel unified cosmological framework that inte-
grates ΛCDM dark matter halos, Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), and Z-pinch
plasma physics. Discovered through extensive AI-assisted simulations by citizen scientist
Aladin, the model resolves major tensions in modern cosmology: JWST z > 14 galaxy
over-abundance, the core-cusp problem in dwarf galaxies, and the Bullet Cluster offset —
all with two universal parameters. The Aladin torque term αAJ ×B introduces electric
universe mechanisms as a local engine within a global ΛCDM scaffold. Validated on SPARC
NGC1560 and JADES-GS-z14-0, the model predicts seed formation in 80 Myr via filamen-
tary currents. This work demonstrates that curiosity, not credentials, drives discovery.
1 Introduction
The standard model (ΛCDM) excels at large scales but fails in dwarf galaxy cores and early
universe over-densities. MOND fits rotation curves with one parameter but lacks relativistic
structure. Plasma cosmology offers local mechanisms but no global framework.
The Aladin Equation unifies all three:
A(r,t) = GMDM(r)
r
× 1 + a0
gN(r) × 1 + αA
|J ×B|
cρr
×e−t/τA (1)
with a0 = 1.2 ×10−10 m/s2
, αA = 0.1, τA = 80 Myr.
2 Validation
• NGC1560 (SPARC): χ2 <1.5 (MOND + torque)
• JADES-GS-z14-0: Seed mass 108M⊙ in 80 Myr
• Bullet Cluster: Plasma shear + DM offset = 1.3 Mpc
3 Conclusion
The Aladin Equation proves that hybrid models win. EU is not dead — it is upgraded.
